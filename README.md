## Introduction

Part 3 of MyApp, the Data Visualization Client, is a Swift application designed to visualize the collected data from the API (Part 2). The client fetches the data using API calls and utilizes SwiftUI and Chart libraries to create a beautiful and interactive chart. The chart will provide users with insights into the collected data, making it easier to understand trends and patterns.

## Features

- Fetch data from the Data API (Part 2) using API calls.
- Display the collected data in an interactive chart using SwiftUI and Chart.
- Provide options for users to customize the chart for a better visualization experience.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running the Data Visualization Client, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Xcode (with Swift support)
- iOS Simulator or a physical iOS device to run the app

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/myapp-data-visualization.git
cd myapp-data-visualization
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:

```
open MyAppDataVisualization.xcodeproj
```

3. Build and run the application using Xcode's iOS Simulator or a connected physical iOS device.

## Configuration

The Data Visualization Client is designed to interact with the Data API (Part 2). Ensure that the API endpoint URLs are correctly configured in the Swift code. Update the API base URL if necessary to connect to the Data API.

## Usage

Upon launching the Data Visualization Client, the app will fetch data from the Data API and display it in the form of a chart. Users can interact with the chart, zoom in/out, and view data points for specific time intervals.

Feel free to customize the user interface, colors, and chart type to suit your specific visualization requirements.
